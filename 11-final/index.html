<article class='about-nigeria'>
<p>Nigeria is located in the West of the African continent, just above the equator.  It is abounded
on the north by Niger Republic, the east by Cameroon, the west by Benin, and the south by the 
Atlantic Ocean.  Although many linguistic groups exist in Nigeria, there are three major tribes 
from which others can trace their origin - Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa.   Each of these tribes have 
their own distinct language and are culturally different. </p>

<p>The Nigerian climate is warm and humid, and consists of two major seasons year round – the rainy
and the dry  seasons.   Rainy season lasts  approximately from  February to October (typically 
in the Southeastern and coastal parts of the country).  The  dry  season runs  from  November  
to  about  January,  and is a predominate season in the Northern regions. </p>

  		<p> Successful architecture is one that highlights harmony between the content 
  		(the building) and the context (the natural landscape).  Here in Igboland, 
  		its natural landscape is beautiful and begs that any additions only enhance 
 		 and not take away from this fact.  While understanding that big houses 
 		 accomodate more people and possessions, the truth is building “big” is 
 		 not without negative consequences.  These include the obvious increase in 
 		 construction costs, time, labor, and the level of difficulty.</p> 

		<p>The “mc-mansion” houses springing up in today’s Nigerian village 
		(specifically Igbo villages) sometimes ignores this.  In order to build “big” 
		huge portions of the natural vegetation are razed and the yard areas paved over.  
		Some compounds do have plantings but they are dwarfed by the scale of the house, 
		in the end it becomes a fight between content (the building) and the context 
		(the natural landscape). </p>

	<p>The end goal of my Thesis research and study is to obtain a residential 
	architectural vernacular within the Igbo village that:

	1. Speaks to this idea of “CONTENT + CONTEXT”
			
	2. Maintains a sense of “PLACE” unchanged even when the “TIME” does. </p>

	<h2> Design Principles </h2>
	<p>To this effect, a set of DESIGN PRINCIPLES intended to guide the future village 
	home builder is proposed.  The following nine points further expand on and explain
	the above mentioned goals:</p>

<p>The architectural style of the house should be respectful and representative of its 
surrounding, i.e. 20 ft high Romanesque columns do not belong on a Nigerian house, 
especially within the village setting.</p>
	
<p>Multi-storied houses do not necessarily have to equal “humungus”.  The scale of the 
house should be proportional to the size of the site, and because it is residential, 
it should also be relative to human scale.</p>
	
<p>The exterior shape/form of the house generally affects its interior layout.Therefore, 
the exterior should balance out the interior in terms of space usage.  Most of these 
monumental houses sometimes have leftover space at the interior (especially at the first 
floor) with no intentional programing.  The most common example of this is houses that end 
up with oversized living rooms due to a huge footprint; it makes the space difficult to 
furnish and unnecessarily monumental in width and height. </p>
	
<p>Some spaces within the house within the house are most useful when they are flexible and
made adaptable to multiple functions .  An “open plan” arrangement at the first floor allows
for this (especially areas designated as public domain) will benefit from this.  
Two spaces can be separate or shared through the use of movable partitions; e.g. 
Living and Family Room.</p>
	
<p>Materials for building in these parts of Nigeria are readily available.  Use building 
materials that: 1. Embody the culture and, 2. Represent appropriate technological 
advancements of the “time and place”; i.e. mud bricks (if one-storey high),  clay tiles, 
concrete, CMU, bamboo, timber and palm fronds.  Use some metals; floor mats; and fabric 
that are representative of the tribe.  It is important to preserve the essence of the 
village architecture, regardless of technological advancements; the significant elements 
of the village and village life can remain intact.</p>
	</article>
	
<p>Maintain historic design and building practices by using elements that enhances the 
uniqueness of the village.  A healthy balance between “old” and “new” design elements and 
principles can be created and high-lighted in the houses being built in today’s village.  
Combinations such as loam walls (wattle and daub construction), thatched roof, clay tile 
roof and walls, wood carved doors, exterior walls with decorative etchings, vegetation and 
the use of low mud wall surrounds to divide compounds will produce a house that showcases 
an essence of the village. </p>
	
<p>The natural vegetation existing throughout the Southern regions offers not just building
resources, but beauty and sustenance; they should be used in the overall compound layout.  
Plants and trees are simple but great elements that can enhance one’s house .  Vegetation 
such as Coconut trees, Orange trees, Hibiscus plants, Palm trees, Mahogany and Mango trees,
are some of the most common indigenous vegetation found in this tropical </p>
	</article>
	
<p>Use building materials and energy conserving practices to create a cool and healthy 
living environment.  This is not a foreign concept in the Nigerian architecture as research
shows that this was the typical practice.  

Although the culture celebrates the extended family and providing separate living quarters 
for different family sects, it is prudent to build one main house for living in lieu of the
former “big house + multiple smaller ones” within one compound.  This will keep costs and 
material usage to a minimum.

Natural ventilation practices should be implemented in order to eliminate the dependency on
air conditioning.  These include plantings close to the house; the use of building materials
such as masonry at the walls and roofs; and the use of casement windows to allow direct 
airflow/exchange.  

In lieu of air conditioning units, ceiling fans are great for air circulation and cooling 
(especially when the space it is cooling is of a small volume, e.g. any areas of 250 square 
feet and below).  As Nigeria is a tropical climate, energy from the sun can be easily harnessed
through photovoltaic 
technology.</p>
	
<p>The Nigerian village, as well as most countries considered as third-world  could be seen as 
places where sustainable and “green” practices are implemented.  

Houses were constructed with thatched roofs made from palm fronds and mud bricks.  These 
supported natural ventilation and air flow, and kept spaces within the house cool during harsh 
heat and humidity.  Covered porches and verandahs were built and used for outdoor seating and 
gathering, while acting as a buffer between the house and the climate.  Also the use of large 
roof overhangs protected the building itself from some damge from rainfall and UV rays from the 
sun.</p>
